# DP-1 Protocol Specification
DPâ€‘1 is an open, vendorâ€‘neutral protocol that bundles a digitally signed JSON "playlist" (plus an optional longâ€‘term capsule) so any compliant playerâ€”from museum screens to home framesâ€”can display blockchainâ€‘native, codeâ€‘based art exactly as the artist intended. Like MIDI or RSS in their domains, it supplies a common rail gauge that ends today's patchwork of adâ€‘hoc embed codes, broken CDN links and browserâ€‘specific hacks. Urgency comes from the wave of generative NFTs now aging out of their original runtimes: if we don't lock in a lightweight standard, artworks will keep degrading or disappearing. Feral File is seeding DPâ€‘1â€”hosting the spec, shipping validator tools and using its own FF1 devices as the first reference implementationâ€”while inviting independent nodes to prove interoperability. 

The longerâ€‘range vision is a durable network where curators publish once and reach every screen. The protocol itself remains free and openâ€‘source so the ecosystem can thrive without locking the rails.
